# GR - A general relativity package

This is a symbolic general relativity calculator based on `Mathematica`.

Giving coordinates, metric and energy-momentum tensor, it will quickly and output-friendly calculate the Christoffel symbols, Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, Einstein tensor, Einstein equations, geodesic equations and anything related if you want.

The package is from https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/8847/ .

Besides, you can test Killing vector, solve Einstein equations...

## Usage

Just download all, and check the `GRnotebook.nb` notebook using `Mathematica`. An example in it is a simple Schwarzschild condition. You can edit it as you want.
